# CodePen Resources

This repository contains various types of external resources used in my CodePens. It's of no use to anyone else because the code here is generally used to demonstrate bugs, code modifications, and there are no complete working projects here.

## What's Here

### Apex Charts JS

* A modified version of v3.22.1 that demonstrates some modifications I made that:
  * File names can be programmatically created for SVG,PNG, and CSV chart downloads.
  * The download menu items are configurable. Each can be individually enabled or disabled programmatically.
* The CodePen source used in the demonstration.

The CodePen demo is [here](<https://codepen.io/jxmot/pen/jOrJpdb>). And the modified Apex source and CodePen source can be found in the folder named **jOrJpdb**.

My modifications to `apexcharts.js` can be found by searching for `jxmot`.
